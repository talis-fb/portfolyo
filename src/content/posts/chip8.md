# A Little Backstory‚Ä¶
This was one of those _‚ÄúI wanna understand how this thing really works‚Äù_ kind of projects.

It all started with a curiosity about how CPUs actually do their thing‚Äîopcodes, memory registers, bit operations, stack calls‚Ä¶ the whole low-level dance. At the same time, I wanted to do something fun! 

Then, why not a video-game like project? Emulators seemed like the perfect playground to explore all that. 
My first idea was to write a NES emulator. It‚Äôs a pretty popular choice‚Äîchallenging but not completely overkill. But the more I thought about it, the more I felt like I didn‚Äôt want to spend months fine-tuning every little quirk of NES hardware just to end up with another ‚Äúlook at my NES emulator‚Äù like the other 34,131 out there üòÖ.

That‚Äôs when I remembered CHIP-8.

CHIP-8 is kind of the "Hello World" of emulators. It‚Äôs simple enough to build solo, but tricky enough to teach you a lot. It has its own tiny instruction set and virtual architecture‚Äîperfect for digging into how an emulator/system really works.

# What I used?

I picked **Go** for this one, even though I already know **Rust** pretty well. Why? I wanted to challenge myself.
Rust is my comfort zone when it comes to systems programming, but Go is something I‚Äôve been exploring more recently. I figured this was a great chance to push myself and build something non-trivial with it.

For the UI, I wanted to go with the classic web trinity: *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*. But I also didn‚Äôt want to deal with a bloated frontend framework. I just needed something simple and clean that could interact with WebAssembly. And most important, I wasn‚Äôt about to give up TypeScript.

That‚Äôs where Vite came in. It made working with `TS + WASM + Tailwind` super smooth‚Äîjust enough structure to keep things organized, but still light and fast.
