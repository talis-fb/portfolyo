TReq is a user-friendly Command Line Interface (CLI) HTTP client, designed to be simple and a complete CLI tool to interact with APIs. With options to save and edit frequently used requests with simple commands to run them again later. Imagine a workflow like GUI tools for HTTP requests in terminal.

This is my first Open Source project. And my big tried to created some helpful tools for me and hopefully for others. It was also the first and definitive project I used to learned Rust. 

Actually, this version is a full rewrite of my original attempt: [https://github.com/talis-fb/legacy_TReq](https://github.com/talis-fb/legacy_TReq). That first version had a lot of flaws due to my lack of experience, but I learned a ton from it. Eventually, I decided to take all those lessons and rebuild it from scratch, with a clearer vision and better code.

# üéØ My goals and ideias...

It started with a simple problem I kept running into as a backend developer:

>
> I just want to re-run a saved API request without opening Postman or writing a giant curl command I‚Äôve already forgotten.
> 

Sure, tools like curl or HTTPie are great for quick requests, but they don‚Äôt really help when:
1. You have a complex payload or tons of query params.
2. You just want to run something you‚Äôve already saved‚Äîwithout reopening a big GUI app.

That‚Äôs when I thought: Why isn‚Äôt there a terminal tool that does this?

My really first and main ideia was focusing in creating a TUI application. Just like a lot of TUI application out there to replace GUI tools, like lazydocker, lazygit, htop, neovim, etc...
TReq should be a TUI tool to deal with HTTP requests.




# ‚ùå TUI First Attempt
My original vision was actually a full TUI (Text User Interface) app using ratatui.

And I did build it. It had screens, panes, keybindings... the whole package.

But eventually I hit a wall.

TUI apps are cool‚Äîbut hard to get right. And no matter how much polish I added, it still didn‚Äôt feel better than just opening a GUI app. The TUI was getting in the way of productivity instead of helping it.

So, I scrapped it.

# ‚úÖ The definitive version

This time, I focused purely on the command line. I wanted something you could use like:
```sh
treq run my-request
```
And that‚Äôs it. Clean, quick, repeatable.

TReq is inspired by HTTPie in terms of syntax and usability, but with a strong focus on persistency and interactive workflows. You can save a request once, and run it again anytime with full support for bodies, headers, auth, and more.

# TL;DR

Submit and saving the request locally as "main-endpoint" with `--save-as` flag

```sh
treq POST example.com name="John Doe" --save-as main-endpoint
```

Executing saved request with run command

```sh
treq run main-endpoint
```

Executing it adding more data

```sh
treq run main-endpoint email='john@gmail.com' job=dev
```

A pratical usage...
```sh
# Create a user and save the request for make it again later
treq POST api.com/user name=John job=dev friends:='["Bob", "Jane"]' birth-year:=1990 --save-as create-user

# Make the same request for create a user "Jane"
treq run create-user name=Jane birth-year:=2001

# Editing saved request
treq edit birth-year:=2002 --method PATCH
```
